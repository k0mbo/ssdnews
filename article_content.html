<p class="p1"><span class="s1">WASHINGTON D.C &#8211; US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that the actions by the United States are to press for the resolution of the <a href="https://m.dw.com/en/tigray-crisis-dents-ethiopias-emerging-image/a-57353459">crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia</a>.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">US visa restrictions were also placed on Ethiopian and Eritrean officials accused of contributing to the six-month-old war in Tigray.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;The time for action from the international community is now,&#8221; Blinken added.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Restrictions targeted &#8220;current or former Ethiopian or Eritrean government officials, members of the security forces, or other individuals — to include Amhara regional and irregular forces and members of the Tigray People&#8217;s Liberation Front (TPLF) — responsible for, or complicit in, undermining resolution of the crisis in Tigray,&#8221; Blinken said.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands more forced from their homes in the <a href="https://m.dw.com/en/tigray-crisis-worsening-with-no-withdrawal-of-eritrean-troops-in-sight-un/a-57220685">Tigray region since November.</a></span></p>
<h4 class="p3"><span class="s2">What is the conflict about?</span></h4>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali sent troops into the Tigray region, which led to the TPLF launching an attack on the Ethiopian army in November 2020. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The TPLF, which has split from Ethiopia&#8217;s now-ruling coalition, was once the country&#8217;s dominant party and carried out an extended war with neighboring Eritrea. Abiy has since been accused of siding with Eritrean forces to pursue the now-fugitive leaders of the TPLF. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Troops from both the Ethiopian and Eritrean military forces have been accused of carrying out <a href="https://m.dw.com/en/ethiopias-tigray-region-war-behind-a-steel-wall/a-56737354">abuses against the civilian population</a> in the border region. The international community has called for the restoration of peace, with the UN and US pushing for the withdrawal of troops from the region.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Both the nations have announced the withdrawal of troops, which is yet to take effect. </span></p>
