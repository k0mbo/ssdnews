<p>45-year-old Pastor Peter Lokai who was serving as head of the African Inland Church in Torit was shot dead on Monday night when the unidentified gunmen called his name out at his residence in Torit several times, according to a government official.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they called at him, it was about 1:00AM in the night. They called his name several times and when he came out to them, they shot him several times and he died instantly,&#8221; the senior government official who refused to be identified told Sudans Post from Torit.</p>
<p>The senior state government official further condemned the incident and however said no arrest has been made adding that state security bodies were still looking for the criminals which he hopes will soon be arrested.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is unacceptable and as a government we condemn this act. The violence which is anywhere in the country shouldn&#8217;t be taken to the church because they are the only people in our country compared to the politicians who are preaching for peace,&#8221; the official added.</p>
<p>&#8220;No arrest has been made and the authorities are hunting for the criminal and very soon we hope the criminals will be arrested and justice will be served,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>The latest criminal activity against the Church in South Sudan comes less than one month after Italian-born Bishop-elect of Rumbek diocese was <a href="https://www.sudanspost.com/gunmen-attack-newly-appointed-rumbek-diocese-bishop/">wounded</a> in an attack on his compound in Lakes state&#8217;s capital Rumbek.</p>
<p>He was flown to Nairobi where he is recovering</p>
<p>Dozens of people have been arrested and sources in the ongoing police investigation have also suggested that the attempt on the Bishop&#8217;s life originated from Juba.</p>
