<p class="p1"><span class="s1">JUBA — Former South Sudan army’s acting spokesman Brigadier General Santo Domic Chol is being quoted as saying that displaced civilians in Juba and other parts of the country are opposition sympathizers who he said are politicizing the current security and economic situation in the country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This comes when contacted by New Humanitarian to possibly inquire over protection of displaced persons following the departure of United Nation peacekeepers from some camps across the country.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While other government officials refused to comment, Domic called the displaced camp residents “opposition sympathisers” who are “politicising the situation”. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For his part, police spokesman Major-General Daniel Justin said displaced persons don’t trust them resulting in a delayed takeover of the security of previously UNMISS-manned POCs in Juba.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Up to now, we have not taken over the [Juba camp] in terms of handling their security issues,” General Justin said. “They are there alone because if we go they will throw stones at us.”</span></p>
