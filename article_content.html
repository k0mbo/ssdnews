<p class="p1"><span class="s1">JUBA &#8211; The International Refugee Committee (IRC) has announced that it is suspended its operation in Southern Unity state’s Ganyliel Payam of Panyinjiar County, according to a statement seen by Sudans Post.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This comes less than one week after a South Sudanese aid worker working for the aid group was killed by unidentified criminals in Ganyliel who, according to authorities, are still at large.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“26 May 2021 Pause of Activities in Ganyliel Payam, Panyilar County, Unity State Following the tragic death Dr. Louis Edward Saleh Ufew, one of our senior medical staff in Ganyliel, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) has paused operations in Ganyliel Payam, Panyijiar County in accordance with IRC global safety and security protocols that require us to undertake a thorough risk assessment when serious incidents such as this one occurs,” the IRC said in the statement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The team is dedicated and working hard to ensure the safest working environment for all our staff. We also stopped operations in honor of our beloved deceased staff, and also for the sake of the psychological wellbeing of his colleagues, both from Unity State and the rest of South Sudan who are understandably very traumatized. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We cannot continue business as usual without first understanding the situation and re-orienting our ways of working in the changed context for IRC to draw some lessons and ensure that this never happens again, given that as an organization besides providing humanitarian services to communities, IRC also has a responsibility of ensuring its staff safety and security. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We request the State and National authorities to expedite their investigations as the outcome will inform our next steps. We will cooperate with the authorities as they carry out their investigations.”</span></p>
