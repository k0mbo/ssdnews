<p class="p1"><span class="s1">JUBA — South Sudan President Salva Kiir Mayardit has revoked the appointment of Ugandan national who was appointed into parliament last week, according to a decree read out on the state-owned South Sudan Broadcasting Corporation (SSBC).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although the decree did not mention why the lady’s appointment was revoked, Ms. Afekuru Animu’s appointment into the Revitalized Transitional National Legislative Assembly (R-TNLA) representing OPP has caused uproar on social media amid reports that she hails from Uganda.</span></p>
<p>Kiir in a separate decree appointed Joseph Lual Achuil to replace her. He issued a separate decree appointing Angui Diing to Simon Mou Thiik who turned down the appointment last week.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ms Animu who was dismissed by First Vice President Taban Deng Gai’s office in 2018 following media reports was appointed last week by President Salva Kiir Mayardit on the ticket of OPP led by Peter Mayen Majongdit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unconfirmed reports also said she was dismissed at some points few years ago by the Japanese embassy over nationality concerns.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her appointment came as a surprise to the community of Lujule Payam of Morobo County of Central Equatoria state Animu now represents in parliament.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In a statement, the community said the person in question does not hail from the area and that they made some investigation as to whether she belongs there, but they said she doesn’t come from their payam.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“After a thorough investigation to know her details, the community found her claims of origination from the Keliko tribe to be false,” reads the statement seen by Sudans Post in part.</span></p>
